# Platform Fees

The Smart Bitcoin Exchange collects a 0.1% fee on the "value" of every transaction (with the exception of NFTs). These fees are deposited directly into their respective SBX Treasuries and become instantly redeemable by ALL SBX stakeholders.

__You need to know! â€”__ During the "Bailout Phase", __100%__ of the fees collected by the Exchange will be deposited into the Bailout Treasury for immediate distribution to "qualifying" $SBX token holders.
