# Exchange Fees

All fees are scheduled and enforced by a collection of "wise" contracts, written in Nexa Script.


## Maintenance Fee

Nexa Exchange collects a __0.01% maintenance fee__, based on the "$NEXA value" _(as per UTXO generated)_ of each transaction. Fees are deposited directly into the Exchange's treasury and used to maintain the platform's _(minimum)_ operational requirements.

:::info
__You should to know! —__ The maintenance fee of __0.01% is FIXED FOREVER__, and can ONLY be changed by an order set forth by the DAO members through a stakeholder vote.
:::


## Platform Fee

Nexa Exchange collects a __platform fee__, based on the "$NEXA value" _(as per UTXO generated)_ of each transaction. Fees are deposited directly into the Exchange's treasury and paid out _(pro-rata)_ to "qualified" [__NEXX__](https://nexa.exchange/nexx) stakeholders.
