## Example

```
# Simple test
$ cd $DingirExchangeDir
# Lanuch the external dependency services like Postgresql and Kafka
$ docker-compose --file "./orchestra/docker/docker-compose.yaml" up --detach
$ make startall # or `cargo run --bin matchengine` to start only core service
$ cd $DingirExchangeDir/examples/js ; npm i
# This script will put orders into the exchange.
# Then you will find some orders got matched, trades generated,
# and users' balances updated accordingly.
$ npx ts-node tests/trade.ts
```

## Release

We uses [cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross) to generate release builds for Linux Distributions.
For example, you could generate a static release build via the below command.

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-static -C target-feature=+crt-static" cross build --bin matchengine --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

And a new Docker image could be generated by the `release` script.

```
# In root directory of this project
./release/release.sh YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY_DOMAIN.COM:YOUR_DOMAIN_PORT NEW_IMAGE_TAG
```
