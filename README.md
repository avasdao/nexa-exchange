### ↳ https://nexa.exchange

Nexa Exchange is a high performance exchange trading server. The core matching engine is a fully async, single threaded, memory based matching engine with thousands of TPS.

### Features

- cryptocurrency deposit/withdraw


## Technical Details

Language: Node.js
API Interface: JSON-RPC
Server framework: Express
Storage: NOSQL Databases
Persistence: (a)Append operation log and (b)Redis-like fork-and-save persistence

The architecture is heavily inspired by Redis and [Viabtc Exchange](https://github.com/viabtc/viabtc_exchange_server)


## Prerequisite

* cmake
* librdkafka

### Ubuntu / Debian

```
# apt install cmake librdkafka-dev
```

### RedHat / CentOS / Fedora

```
# dnf install cmake librdkafka-devel
```

### MacOS

```
$ brew install cmake librdkafka
```


## Todos

* push notifications using websockets
* API documentation
* Better test coverage

## Example

```
# Simple test
$ cd $DingirExchangeDir

# Lanuch the external dependency services like Postgresql and Kafka
$ docker-compose --file "./orchestra/docker/docker-compose.yaml" up --detach
$ make startall # or `cargo run --bin matchengine` to start only core service
$ cd $DingirExchangeDir/examples/js ; npm i

# This script will put orders into the exchange.
# Then you will find some orders got matched, trades generated,
# and users' balances updated accordingly.
$ npx ts-node tests/trade.ts
```

## Release

We uses [cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross) to generate release builds for Linux Distributions.
For example, you could generate a static release build via the below command.

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-static -C target-feature=+crt-static" cross build --bin matchengine --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

And a new Docker image could be generated by the `release` script.

```
# In root directory of this project
./release/release.sh YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY_DOMAIN.COM:YOUR_DOMAIN_PORT NEW_IMAGE_TAG
```
